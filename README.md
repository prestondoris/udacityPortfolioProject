# Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree: Portfolio Project

This project was designed around applying my HTML and CSS skill towards buildings a portfolio website. A design mockup as a PDF-file was provided, and the requirements of the project were to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I was responsible for developing a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of the Nanodegree program.
